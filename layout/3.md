```diff
#header {
  background: #F66; /* red */
}
#preface {
  background: #66F; /* blue */
+ float: right;
}
#content {
  background: #FF6; /* yellow */
}
```

Well, that didn't work. Why? A `float`ed element will fill as much of the container width as it wants and no more. In this case, the two paragraphs are long enough to force the preface block to fill the full width of its container.
