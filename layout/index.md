<h1>Basic Layout</h1>
<p>This is the third installment in a series on CSS. The way it works is pretty simple: follow along with these cards in the corner, while the rest of the page loads examples associated with the card. It's the most direct way I can think of to show and tell at the same time in a web-friendly format.</p>
<p>The goal of this format is to make it easier to learn CSS and see some of its benefits directly. Stylesheets are not terribly difficult to use and are quite powerful, but they require some planning ahead and a little different way of thinking than using a word processor or other &lsquo;visual&rsquo; editor for formatting. I do encourage more people to learn the ins and outs of CSS for styling and laying out web pages, and I hope that this makes it that much easier.</p>
<p>This is still only a draft. If, when you&rsquo;re done, you have any thoughts on how I might improve things, or just want to get in touch, please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:nfscott@gmail.com">nfscott@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!</p>
