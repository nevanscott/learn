# Turning the Tables

This is the second in a series of CSS tutorials. In the first, <a href="../basics/">Styling the Basics</a>, we covered some of the more rudimentary aspects of what CSS can do by styling an essay. In this lesson, we'll tackle a table, which presents slightly different challenges.

The way this works is pretty simple. Follow along here to the left while examples load in the area to the right.

As with the other tutorials in this series, this lesson should be considered *only a draft*. I still imagine it is in a state to be valuable to those interested in learning to use CSS, but I would love any comments, suggestions, or feedback. After looking this tutorial over, if you'd like to get in touch, please email me at <a href="mailto:nfscott@gmail.com">nfscott@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy!
