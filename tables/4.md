<p>In order to differentiate the calendars themselves from their monthly titles, let&rsquo;s set their fonts to one with serifs and one without.</p>

<pre>
h2 {
	text-align: center;
	<ins>font-family: Georgia;</ins>
	}
table {
	text-align: center;
	margin: auto;
	<ins>font-family: Arial;</ins>
	}
</pre>

<p>Here, Georgia and Arial are a matter of personal choice and style. It is generally a better idea to offer alternative faces when specifying a <code>font-family</code>, but I have forgone this practice here for the sake of simplicity.</p>
