<p>With the calendars looking much more like calendars, much easier to recognize and read at a glance than before, let&rsquo;s turn to adding a little more useful visual information to them by highlighting the current week and day. In order to do this, we must first differentiate these within the HTML:</p>

<pre>
&hellip;
&lt;tr <ins>class="thisweek"</ins>&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;22&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;23&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;25&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;26&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td <ins>class="today"</ins>&gt;27&lt;/td&gt;
	&lt;td&gt;28&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&hellip;
</pre>

<p>These could just as easily be <code>id</code>s rather than <code>class</code>es in this case, but it is possible to imagine a case where we would want to highlight different days and weeks on different calendars along a page. My general rule is to use an <code>id</code> only when I have a particular reason to want only one of something on the page, usually for the sake of prominence. Elsewhere, a <code>class</code> is generally more appropriate.</p>
