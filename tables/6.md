To give the calendar more of a grid to lend some visual structure, let's add a light border around each of the table cells (`td`), like so:

```css
td {
  border: 1px solid #CCCCCC;
}
```

This isn't exactly what we want, because there's still a bit of white space surrounding each of the cells. The trick to this is the secret ingredient for almost any table-styling efforts.
