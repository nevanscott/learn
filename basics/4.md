Leading (sometimes called spacing; `line-height` in CSS) also has a strong impact on readability, for the same reason. Separating long lines of text by vertical space gives the eye more room to stay on track when scanning to the next line. Generally speaking, wider paragraphs need more leading. Since we're using a fairly narrow width, we'll set the `line-height` to just a few points more than the `font-size`.

From a purely aesthetic point of view, controlling the leading on a page is one of the many ways to manage the white space in a design.
