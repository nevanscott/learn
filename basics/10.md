While we're at it, let's go ahead and set the size of the title and byline. If I'm setting font sizes in points, I try to stick with the usual set of sizes you might find in your text editor. They were originally chosen for he harmony of their proportion, which sounds good to me, so I'm using 18pt and 12pt Georgia.

With the `font-size` specified on all of the block-level tags that we're using, the `font-size` declaration on `body` is redundant. I went ahead and moved the `line-height` to the `p` tag as well, since the 14pt line-height is really only appropriate to the 9pt paragraphs.
