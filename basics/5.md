We can add a margin on either side of the body, which effectively centers the text block within the window. The advantage of doing so is to create more white space around the text, leaving more room for the eye to concentrate on reading--without, for example, the distraction of whatever sits just to the side of the browser window.

```diff
body {
  font-size: 133.33333%;
  line-height: 1.3;
  width: 30em;
+ margin: auto;
}
```
