It's difficult to read long lines of text, because the eye easily gets lost when scanning back across the page to a new line. We can improve readability here by making the page itself narrower. Without going into too many details, roughly 60 characters per line is generally good for paragraphs of text. 1em measures the  *height* of the type, each character width is roughly  half that, so in order to get roughly 60 characters per line, we'll use a width of 30em.

```diff
body {
  font-size: 133.33333%;
+ width: 30em;
}
```

(Confused? Try a calulator: 1em &times; 60 &divide; 2 = 30em)
