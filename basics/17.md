To get the link in the byline to go with the flow a little better, we'll change its color to black to match the rest of the line and give it a faint border across the bottom (rather than an underline) to more subtley indicate that it links somewhere. The following targets only links inside `h2` elements:

```css
h2 a {
  color: #000000;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #CCC;
}
```

Underlining is a fairly standard visual cue for links. In fact, it's a good general rule to reserve underlining for links only. To add emphasis, use italics.
