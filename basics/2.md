<p>First, we'll set up some general rules that apply to the entire body of the document. Let's start off by changing the font size for the page to 11pt like so:</p>

```css
body {
	font-size: 11pt;
}
```

<p>This should make everything on the page a little bit smaller than before, because most browsers use a 12pt font as the base size by default. Notice how the title and byline shrink with the rest of the text, but they don't shrink to 11pt. Setting the <code>font-size</code> on the <code>body</code> changes the base font size. The browser sets sizes for things like headlines proportionately to this base.</p>
