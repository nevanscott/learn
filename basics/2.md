First, we'll set up some general rules that apply to the entire body of the document. Let's start off by increasing the font size for the page.

```css
body {
  font-size: 133.33333%;
}
```

This should make everything on the page a little bit larger than before. Because most browsers use a 12pt font as the base size by default, this will set the body text at 16pt.

Notice how the title and byline grow with the rest of the text, and don't resize to 16pt. Setting the `font-size` on the `body` changes the base font size. The browser sets sizes for things like headlines proportionately to this base.
