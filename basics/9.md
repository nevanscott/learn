css: |
  body {
    font-size: 100%;
    line-height: 1.45;
    width: 35em;
    margin: auto;
  }
  h1, h2 {
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
    font-weight: normal;
    text-align: center;
  }
  p {
    font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
  }

In the process of changing the body font to Verdana, we made our paragraphs pretty chunky, and actually *less* readable. Let's counteract both these problems by increasing the line length, decreasing the font size, and breathing a little extra room between the lines of text.
