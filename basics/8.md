The default font for most browsers is either Times, Arial, or some variant. These are perfectly fine fonts, but there are others at our disposal. Choosing fonts is a balancing act between what you can use, what will add character, and what will be readable. More often than not, you'll use a very limited set of fonts.

Georgia and Verdana are particularly popular on the web. Georgia's quirky elegance makes it a nice serif font for titles. Verdana, while grotesque (in my opinion--and evidenced here) at larger sizes, is eminently readable at very small sizes despite *its own* quirks.

Georgia also looks a little cleaner to me at its normal weight. Since browsers default to bolding headlines, we've also set `font-weight: normal;` on the title and byline.
