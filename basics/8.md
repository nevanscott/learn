<p>The default font for most browsers is either Times, Arial, or some variant. These are perfectly fine fonts, but there are others at our disposal. Choosing fonts is a balancing act between what you can use, what will add character, and what will be readable. More often than not, you&rsquo;ll use a very limited set of fonts.</p>
<p>Georgia and Verdana are particularly popular on the web. Georgia&rsquo;s quirky elegance makes it a nice serif font for titles. Verdana, while grotesque (in my opinion&mdash;and evidenced here) at larger sizes, is eminently readable at very small sizes despite <em>its own</em> quirks.</p>

<pre>
[&hellip;]
h1, h2 {
	text-align: center;
<ins>	font-family: Georgia;
	font-weight: normal;</ins>
	}
<ins>p {
	font-family: Verdana;
	}</ins>
</pre>

<p>Georgia also looks a little cleaner to me at its normal weight. Since browsers default to bolding headlines, we&rsquo;ve also set <code>font-weight: normal;</code> on the title and byline.
