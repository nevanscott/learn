By zeroing out the margin below the title and above the byline, we remove the space between the two, giving them a literally closer relationship.

I've also set the margins above and below each paragraph to 14 points: equivalent to the `line-height`. This sets an even rhythm for the reader, leaving the vertical space of exactly one full line between paragraphs.
